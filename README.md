# Early-Flood-Detection-System-Using-IOT
This IoT-Based Early Flood Detection System uses an ESP8266 microcontroller with DHT11, ultrasonic, and flow sensors to monitor flood-prone areas. It displays alerts on an LCD and sends notifications to the cloud, ensuring timely updates. This project enhances disaster preparedness and response, effectively protecting communities from flood risks.
